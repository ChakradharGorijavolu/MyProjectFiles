In a client-server architecture:

Client Tier: 
This tier consists of the client machines, which are typically end-user devices such as computers, smartphones, or tablets.
Clients initiate requests to the server and receive responses.

Server Tier: This tier comprises the server or servers that provide services or resources to clients.
Servers respond to client requests, perform processing, and send back the results.

In scenarios where there are multiple clients interacting with a server, such as in web applications or online games,
this client-server architecture facilitates communication and data exchange between the clients and the central server.
Each client independently communicates with the server, often over a network, to access resources, perform actions, or retrieve information.

TCP Client/Server Communication

Execution:
First run the server->
g++ server.cpp -o server
./server  //output file

Run the client->
g++ client.cpp -o client
./client   //output file


In DBMS there are three tiers of Architecture:
1.1-Tier Architecture
2.2-Tier Architecture
3.3-Tier Architecture
